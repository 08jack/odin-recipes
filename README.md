# odin-recipes
Hi! This is my first project for The Odin Project. I was tasked to create a website using HTML featuring three recipes, each on their own webpage.

I had to apply what I've been learning about HTML, including using basic elements such as headers, lists, images and links.

I'll be honest, I'm not a big fan of cooking. So I decided to use very simple foods as I think the most important part of the project was getting hands-on in HTML, not the content of the site itself.

Overall I enjoyed this project and I'm very much enjoying TOP. I'm really looking forward to learning more!
